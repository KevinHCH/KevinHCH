# ⚡ Kevin Herbas | Backend & AI Engineer | RAG, Automation, Scraping

I design and build production-ready backends and applied AI systems. My work focuses on turning messy data into structured intelligence and creating automation pipelines that actually scale.

- Reduced product compliance checks from 2 weeks to under 1 minute with AI
- Automated discovery and analysis of 10k+ EU procurement tenders daily
- Delivered fullstack scrapers and dashboards powering 120k+ listings per week

## 🚀 Highlight Projects
- 🛡 Compliance AI Product Validator - Automated PDF & image checks with instant reporting
- 🌍 Vitellus - European procurement intelligence platform with AI-powered insights
- 🕷 KRAVEN - Scrapy + Django fullstack job scraper and dashboard
- 🎨 Charis CLI - Open-source Gemini CLI for image generation and editing

More details and case studies available in pinned repositories.

## 💡 Technical Philosophy
